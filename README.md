# Uno bot
## Inspiration

## Current progress
Rewrote the card object in python (probably has to be further refined)

## Limitations
* Player can only have a maximum of 25 cards, this is due to discord button limitations

## Python modules to interact with discord
* https://guide.pycord.dev/
* https://github.com/VL07/discord.py-game-engine

## TODO
Everything else
